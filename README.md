Welcome to *DFLIP-3K*, a deepfake database (DFLIP-3K) for the development of convincing and explainable deepfake detection:

> ✅ **3K+ generative models**: *DFLIP-3K* provides deepfake images generated by at leasts 3K+ generative models.
> 
> ✅ **Inguistic footprints of these deepfakes**: *DFLIP-3K* offers an integrated framework for the implementation of state-of-the-art detection methods.
> 
> ✅ **Standardized Evaluations**: *DFLIP-3K* introduces standardized evaluation metrics and protocols to enhance the transparency and reproducibility of performance evaluations.
> 
> ✅ **Open database**: *DFLIP-3K* is an open database that fosters transparency and encourages collaborative efforts to 
further enhance its growth.

## 📚 Features
<a href="#top">[Back to top]</a>

DFLIP-3K has the following features:

⭐️  DFLIP-3K database encompasses approximately **300K** deepfake samples produced from about **3K** generative models.   
⭐️  **190K** textual prompts that are used to create images.   
⭐️  Linguistic profiling in simultaneous deepfake detection, identification, and prompt prediction. 

DFLIP-3K will be continuously updated to track the latest advances in deepfake.

The collection of DFLIP-3K and implementations of detection methods is an ongoing project. 

**You are welcome to contribute your methods and data to DFLIP-3K.**

## Visualization
The project page displays a limited selection of DFLIP-3K samples, comprising images and prompts.

## ⏳ Quick Start

### 1. Download Data

<a href="#top">[Back to top]</a>

Please download metadata we proveded from this [URL](https://github.com/dflip3k/storage).
Metadata is stored in this repository in JSON format.
Upon downloading metadata, please ensure to store them in the [`./datasets`](./datasets/) folder.


Once you have downloaded metadata, you can proceed with running the following line to download image:

Note that it may fail several times due to unstable network connections, but the script can be restarted and downloaded files will not be re-downloaded.

```
cd utils

python downloader.py --meta_file [Path to JSON file].json --save_dir [where to save iamges]
```

```
